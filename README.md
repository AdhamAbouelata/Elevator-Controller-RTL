This repo contains an elevator controller project using VHDL. The target device for hardware verification is a cyclone 5 5ceba4f23c7. However, small adjustments are needed to tailor it for the FPGA. 
The testbench is elevator_tb, all other vhd files are RTL, and the simulation script is run_elevator.do. This is for questa/modelsim
